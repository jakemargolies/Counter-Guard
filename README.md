# Counter-Guard

An automatic cat sprayer for kitchen counters

**Project Author: Jacob Margolies**

# Problem Background

Many cat owners (myself included) have brazen pets that feel entitled to roam the surfaces upon which their human companions prepare and eat food, namely kitchen countertops. Unfortunately, our furry friends spend a good deal of their day mucking about in boxes filled with their own excrement which means those cute little paws can carry loads of not-so-cute germs. 

Currently, the cat is pretty heavily incentivized to "counter surf", as some pet owners refer to this behavior, not only because they have a chance to snatch up some stray morsels left out, but also because cats enjoy higher vantage points. While this makes for a great deal for the cat, we can't have them tracking their business all over what should be a sanitary surface. This means there needs to exist adequate disincentive for a stroll on the kitchen island. *Cue: water spray bottle.* 

The water spray bottle is the go-to choice for cat behavioral correction, but has several downsides:

  1. The user must move to the spray bottle, which most cats will learn, giving the animal an opportunity to escape. Far from disincentivizing, this merely forces the cat to be more clever with their strategy. 
  2. Many cats, especially when engaging in food-seeking behavior, will still seek out negative attention over being ignored. This can counterintuitively lead to the punished behavior becoming reinforced. 
  
In order to effectively curb this unwanted behavior, these problems must be overcome with a solution that removes the direct physical intervention from the user.

# User Needs

An effective solution must meet two central requirements:
  1. Always spray a cat with water whenever it jumps onto the countertop
  2. Never spray humans that enter the kitchen 

While there exist many DIY projects on the internet that accomplish the first function, they do not make an attempt to discern between human and animal targets. This element is critical for the solution to be practical in a home environment.

# Proposed Solution Design

The proposed design combines ideas from existing projects with knowledge acquired during the ECE 4180 coursework at Georgia Tech. 

The solution works by using a motion sensor to detect the presence of a moving object on the countertop, and spraying water at the object (cat) when the system is "armed". When the user plans on entering the kitchen, they use the interface provided on their phone to disarm the device via bluetooth. Once disarmed, the user receives a message that the system is disabled, and the screen on the device indicates that it is safe to approach. Because the system power is supplemented with a rechargeable battery used to power the sprayer pump, the device cannot be armed if the battery is too low. The user will receive a message on their phone which tells them the system cannot be armed until properly charged. As soon as the battery is charged, the user receives a message that the device is once again armable.

# Parts

To create this system the following components are required:
  1. Mbed - LPC1768
  2. PIR motion detector
  3. LCD display - uLCD-144-G2 from 4D systems
  4. Adafruit Bluetooth low energy UART module
  5. 2N3904 Transistor, 1kâ„¦, and diode (for pump on/off circuit)
  7. Electric Plant Mister Spray Bottle - (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087TSDMJQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)

## Modifying the Electric Sprayer

### Inside the Sprayer

Inside the sprayer there are 3 boards, a rechargeable battery, and a DC motor pump with inlet and outlet tubing.

### Main PCB

![image of sprayer](/images/main_sprayer_board.jpg "Main Board")

The main PCB has connections to the other boards, a microcontroller that governs the behavior of the device, some passive elements including four battery indicator LEDs, and a slide connector for the battery which feeds into a voltage regulator. The lowest of these battery indicator LEDs will be used as an input to the Mbed to determine when the battery has been depleted (when the LED turns off).

### Main PCB Reverse Side

On the back of the main board we can see another slide connector providing DC power to the pump. There is also a 5V connection for the charging port and two connections to something called "key".

### Button/Trigger

Here is the board connected to the board on the pads labelled "key". It is a SPST button that established continuity between the two leads coming off of it. Here you can see that I have soldered two additional jumper cables so that the trigger can be activated programmatically using the Mbed. This is the integral interaction point with the rest of the system.

### Battery

This is the rechargeable battery that comes inside the sprayer. Oddly enough, it is 3.7V. I opted to reuse all of the internal components from the sprayer in my design, but a potential option would be using a buck converter or voltage regulator to step up the 3.3V provided by the Mbed to match the 3.7V the main board needs in order to avoid using this battery, but for me it was more convenient to leave it in since I needed supplemental power anyway.
